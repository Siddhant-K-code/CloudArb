- **Real-time pricing collection**
- **Linear programming optimization**
- **ML forecasting for price trends**

## 📱 Starting Point (July 20)

> *"Testing diff. optimization algo.: Greedy → suboptimal, Brute force → too slow, Linear programming → promising but complex"*

**Initial State:**
- 15s pricing collection
- 2+ minutes optimization
- Frequent API failures

## 🚀 3-Day Progress Journey

### Day 1: Algorithm Testing
- Tested greedy, brute force, linear programming
- Linear programming showed promise
- Identified performance bottlenecks

### Day 2: Linear Programming Implementation
- Implemented Google OR-Tools
- Added constraint satisfaction
- Performance: 8s collection, 45s optimization

### Day 3: Async Optimization
- Parallel async collection
- Redis caching implementation
- Performance: 2.3s collection, <30s optimization

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Pricing Collection** | 15s | 2.3s | **85% faster** |
| **Optimization Solve** | 2+ min | <30s | **90% faster** |
| **API Success Rate** | Frequent failures | 99.2% | **Production ready** |
